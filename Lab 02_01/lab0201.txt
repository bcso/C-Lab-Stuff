5. By entering 876 543 to the_int, the input is seperated into two imputs with the space as the seperator, and inputs 543 as the input to the second cin command, for the_double. The output shows this is the case. Furthermore if the input is 12.3456, it seems that it takes the 12 as an integer, and takes the trailing decimals as a double and outputs these accordingly. The input of .995 has no affect on the initialized varibles, if it is the input for cin for the_int.
